# Career Advice Sessions

## Lauren Michael and Greg Wilson, October 2016

**Summary:** We propose a task force to organize and run three sessions
in which senior community members offer career advice for junior
community members.

## Specific Goals

Run one career advice session a month for three consecutive months,
then report back to the Mentoring Subcommittee on whether such
sessions should be made a regular part of our schedule.

*   Sessions run in January, February, and March 2017.  Each session is
    one hour long and takes place online.

*   3-4 senior community members (tenured faculty and people at
    equivalent levels in non-academic institutions).

*   Up to 20 junior participants per session.

*   In order to qualify for a spot, the junior participant must
    have taken part in a debriefing session in the previous three
    months.

*   Participation is first-come, first-served.

## Steps to Achieve Goals

1.  Pick time slots.

2.  Recruit senior community members.  If we cannot find enough senior
    community members, halt and catch fire.

3.  Advertise to instructors.

4.  Run sessions.

5.  Poll participants for feedback.

6.  ...

7.  Profit.

## Timeline

*   Time slots chosen and senior community members recruited by
    December 2016.

*   Advertising to community starts early January 2017.

*   Sessions run Jan-Mar 2017.

*   Report to Steering Committee by end of April 2017.

## Assessment

Progress will be measured and reported against the timeline above.

## Community Support

*   Several junior community members have asked for opportunities to get
    career advice from senior members in the past year (both about how
    Software Carpentry activities can help their careers, and about
    non-tenure stream career paths).

## Budget

No budget required.
